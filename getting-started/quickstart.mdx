## Install the Clueso Chrome Extension

In this guide, we'll record our screen to capture a rough screen recording, and turn that rough recording into a polished video. 

To capture recordings, you'll need to install the Clueso chrome extension. 

1. Head to the Clueso extension on the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clueso-extension/hnfgakkbiefcdbkonflgfkadncclmpme?hl=en-GB&authuser=0) then click **Add to Chrome** \> **Add extension**.
